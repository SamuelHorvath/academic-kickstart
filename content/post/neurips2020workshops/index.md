Our paper [**Optimal Client Sampling for Federated Learning**](/publication/fl_optimal_sampling/), joint work with **Wenlin Chen** and [**Peter Richtarik**](https://richtarik.org/), was accepted to [Privacy Preserving Machine Learning workshop](https://ppml-workshop.github.io/). In addition, our work [**Adaptivity of Stochhastic Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Optimization**](/publication/sc_sarah/), joint work with [**Michael I. Jordan**](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/), [**Lihua Lei**](https://lihualei71.github.io/), and [**Peter Richtarik**](https://richtarik.org/), was accepted to [Optimization for Machine Learning workshop](https://opt-ml.org/) as a **Spotlight** talk. Lastly, [**A Better Alternative to Error Feedback for Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning**](/publication/euf/), joint work with [**Peter Richtarik**](https://richtarik.org/), and [**On Biased Compression for Distributed Learning**](/publication/biased_compression/), joint work with [**Aleksandr Beznosikov**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hVVJR-sAAAAJ&hl=ru), [**Mher Safaryan**](https://mher-safaryan.github.io/)  and [**Peter Richtarik**](https://richtarik.org/),  were selected as **contributed talks** at [Workshop on Scalability, Privacy, and Security in Federated Learning](http://icfl.cc/SpicyFL/2020).
